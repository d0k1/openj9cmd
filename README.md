# OpenJ9 Diagnostic tool
OpenJ9 doesn't have any command line diagnostic utilities like jstack / jmap / jstat / jcmd.
It is because OpenJ9 does not have Attach API extensions as OpenJDK have at the moment.
This project demonstrates abilities of Attach API in OpenJ9 that are added with https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/issues/2543
